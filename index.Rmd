# Preface

This is an attempt to use {targets} with {bookdown} to track the status of chapter and not re-run chapters each time the book needs to be rebuilt.

## To run the book

* Install the {targets} package and {bookdown}
* Type `tar_make()` at the command line.
* Look in the `_book` folder for the `index.html` file and open that.

## To add chapters

* The chapters are in the `chapters` folder. Add an Rmd there.
* Open the `_targets.R` file and add something like target_factory(chap2)` but replace `chap2` with your file name.
* `chapters/chap3` shows and example where the chapter uses targets markdown to create a chapter specific pipeline. To run, set `chapters/chap3` as the working directory, open `chap3.Rmd` and knit. Then
