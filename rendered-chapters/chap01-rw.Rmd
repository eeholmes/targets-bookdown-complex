## Discussion

For your homework this week, we will continue to investigate common
trends in the Lake Washington plankton data.

1.  Fit other DFA models to the phytoplankton data with varying numbers
    of trends from 1-4 (we fit a 3-trend model above). Do not include
    any covariates in these models. Using `R="diagonal and unequal"` for
    the observation errors, which of the DFA models has the most support
    from the data?

    Plot the model states and loadings as in Section
    @ref(sec-dfa-estimated-states). Describe the general patterns in the
    states and the ways the different taxa load onto those trends.

    Also plot the the model fits as in Section @ref(sec-dfa-plot-data).
    Do they reasonable? Are there any particular problems or outliers?

2.  How does the best model from Question 1 compare to a DFA model with
    the same number of trends, but with `R="unconstrained"`?

    Plot the model states and loadings as in Section
    @ref(sec-dfa-estimated-states). Describe the general patterns in the
    states and the ways the different taxa load onto those trends.

    Also plot the the model fits as in Section @ref(sec-dfa-plot-data).
    Do they reasonable? Are there any particular problems or outliers?

3.  Fit a DFA model that includes temperature as a covariate and 3
    trends (as in Section @ref(sec-dfa-lakeWA)), but
    with`R="unconstrained"`? How does this model compare to the model
    with `R="diagonal and unequal"`? How does it compare to the model in
    Question 2?

    Plot the model states and loadings as in Section
    @ref(sec-dfa-estimated-states). Describe the general patterns in the
    states and the ways the different taxa load onto those trends.

    Also plot the the model fits as in Section @ref(sec-dfa-plot-data).
    Do they reasonable? Are there any particular problems or outliers?
