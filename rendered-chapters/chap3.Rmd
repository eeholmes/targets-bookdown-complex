Chapter 3
================

This chapter shows how you might use Target Markdown to create a target
pipeline for a specific chapter. It will create the {target} files in
the chapter folder so youâ€™ll want a separate folder for the chapter. To
work on the chapter, you would set the working directory to the chapter
folder. Then you can use the usual {targets} workflow and
visualizations.

The chapter at <https://books.ropensci.org/targets/markdown.html> walks
through it in detail. This R Markdown template is based off what you get
using File &gt; New &gt; RMarkdown &gt; Template &gt; Targets Markdown

## How to run this.

Just hit the Knit button.

Whatâ€™s it going to do? Basically it will create the target objects in
`_targets` and then the markdown text will use those target objects.
That way you donâ€™t end up re-running lengthy things. How is this
different from caching? Well you explicitly specify the dependencies of
your objects. {targets} is smart and will figure out if it needs to
re-make an object based on whether it or its dependencies changed. Also
caching crashes {bookdown} constantly.

## Packages

The example requires several R packages, and `targets` must be version
0.5.0.9000 or above.

``` r
install.packages(c("biglm", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "readr", "targets", "tidyr"))
```

## Setup

If you are using old versions of `targets` (&lt;= 0.7.0) and/or `knitr`
(&lt;= 1.33), you will need to load the `targets` package in the R
Markdown document in order for Target Markdown code chunks to work.

``` r
library(targets)
```

Near the top of the document, you may also wish to remove the
`_targets_r` directory previously written by non-interactive runs of the
report. Otherwise, your pipeline may contain superfluous targets.

``` r
library(targets)
tar_unscript()
```

## Globals

We first define some global options/functions common to all targets. The
function below plots a histogram of ozone concentrations, and our
histogram target will need it.

``` r
options(tidyverse.quiet = TRUE)
tar_option_set(packages = c("biglm", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "readr", "tidyr"))
create_plot <- function(data) {
  ggplot(data) +
    geom_histogram(aes(x = Ozone), bins = 12) +
    theme_gray(24)
}
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/globals/example-globals.R.
```

## Targets

This is the important part. Notice that it uses `{targets ...}` not
`{r ...}`. You need to define dependencies (like data) as a target
object so that {targets} can keep track of whether it needs to update
objects based on changes to its dependencies.

*How will you use these?* Not here. This is just defining them. Scroll
down to see how to use them. Note you donâ€™t have to define all your
targets in one place. Scroll down to see examples.

Our first target borrows the `airquality` dataset built into base R.

``` r
tar_target(raw_data, airquality)
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/raw-data.R.
```

Our next targets preprocess the data, make a histogram, and fit a model.

``` r
list(
  tar_target(data, raw_data %>% filter(!is.na(Ozone))),
  tar_target(hist, create_plot(data))
)
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/downstream-targets.R.
```

Set the `tar_simple` chunk option to `TRUE` to define a single target
with the command in the code chunk. The chunk below only contains
`biglm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp, data)` in the source, but because
`tar_simple` is `TRUE`, it is shorthand for
`tar_target(name = fit, command = biglm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp, data))`.
All other arguments to `tar_target()` are set to their default values
(configurable with `tar_option_set()`).

``` r
tar_target(fit, {
  biglm(Ozone ~ -1 + Wind + Temp, data)
})
#> Define target fit from chunk code.
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/fit.R.
```

You need to be careful how you name things. You donâ€™t want to name an
object to the name of a targets object. So like in the code above, you
donâ€™t want to use `data` as a name in that code chunk since `data` is
now a targets object.

## Pipeline

If you ran all the `{targets}` chunks in non-interactive mode, then your
R scripts are set up to run the pipeline. *I donâ€™t know what this
means.*

``` r
tar_make()
#> [31mâœ“ skip target raw_data
#> [39m[31mâœ“ skip target data
#> [39m[31mâœ“ skip target fit
#> [39m[31mâœ“ skip target hist
#> [39m[31mâœ“ skip pipeline
#> [39m[31mWarning message:
#> package â€˜targetsâ€™ was built under R version 4.1.2 
#> [39m
```

## Output

You can retrieve results from the `_targets/` data store using
`tar_read()` or `tar_load()`.

``` r
library(biglm)
tar_read(fit)
#> Large data regression model: biglm(Ozone ~ -1 + Wind + Temp, data)
#> Sample size =  116
```

``` r
tar_read(hist)
```
