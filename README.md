# Multivariate Autoregressive Models for Environmental Sciences with {targets}

Fundamentally {targets} and {bookdown} don't play nice together since I cannot see any way to render but keep the figure legends and references. See targets-bookdown repo for more info.

For info on building the book with bookdown, go [HERE](https://github.com/nwfsc-timeseries/MARSSES/blob/master/README_Bookdown.md)

## Topics

- Random walks and autoregressive processes
