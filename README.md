 # More complex example using {targets} and {bookdown}

Fundamentally {targets} and {bookdown} don't play nice together since I cannot see any way to render but keep the figure legends and references. See targets-bookdown repo for more info.

For info on building the book with bookdown, go to `README_Bookdown.md`
